## SIMULATION INSTRUCTIONS

#### 1. Extract the file 'project_pix.xpr' by selecting the directory '...\project_pixV3'.

#### 2. Start and run the 'rgb_coeGen' program (make sure the matlab file is opened from this directory) after entering the chosen image size in the 'dim' variable).

#### 3. Start the Vivado 'project_pix' project.

#### 4. Configure the TOP module and testbench TB_TOP_PIX with the chosen size, then launch the implementation (ask the developers for strategies to use).

#### 5. Launch the behavioral simulation or timing post implementation by commenting on line 159 or 158 of tb, respectively.

#### 6. Start and run the 'rgb_filter' program.

#### 7. Share the resulting image and evaluate the results.
